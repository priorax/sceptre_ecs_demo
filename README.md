# Sceptre demo

So.. https://github.com/cloudreach/sceptre came up in my github explore page... I _really_ like the look of it.

It helps to helps address a lot of the issues I've had at work caused by nested Cloudformation stacks and pains from using outputs and needing to manage what arn's are used where.

This is hopefully a useful demo to help anyone else interested with getting your head around it
